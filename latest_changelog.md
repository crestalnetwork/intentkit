## What's Changed

* **Hourly Budget Tracking** - Added configurable hourly budget limit for base LLM usage with Redis-backed tracking. When the limit is exceeded, agents return a friendly message instead of processing requests. This helps manage costs by setting per-hour spending limits.
* **Bug Fixes** - Fixed minor issues in the budget and credit modules.
